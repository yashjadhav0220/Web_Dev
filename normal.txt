This is just a demo 1
This has more to do 

git remote add origin SSH (To add your files/folders to be pulled or pushed on Github rep)

Always check for git status 
To initialize a new git repository use 
git init 

git add .  or git add -A or git add -u 
git commit -m "Message" 
git push origin master or git push for master branch 
 ** To add to another branch use git push origin branch-name**

git diff filename
To restore the changes or to undo the changes use 
git reset filename
git checkout filename or .

To add files or extensions of file which user doesn't want to track during his project developement
touch .gitignore (creates a new file named .gitignore ) 
to open the file use file editor .gitignore

git add -A stages All files
git add . stages new and modified , without deleted 
git add -u stages modified and deleted , without new 

To take any repo to your machine 
git clone [url] (ssh is more prefered )
For the entire repository use . at the end 
ex git clone [url] (ssh is more prefered ) .

To create branches use 
git branch branch-name
To switch to another branch from master branch use 
**git checkout branch-name

To merge from branch to master use 
git merge branch-name and then push using 
git push -u origin master

To remove a branch use 
git branch -d branchname 

fork: When you have to make any changes to someone else's project first fork that as we should not make any changes to the main branch (upstream)
Once fork is done then you can make any feature changes my creating a *branch* for your forked repository 
Then the owner of the main branch will "Compare and check the pull request" and then decide whether it should be merged with it 
fork->clone->branch->checkout->changes->add->commit->push->PR

for every change i.e one pull request = one branch
